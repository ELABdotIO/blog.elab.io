While I was driving to YMCA one night, I was heard this song "My savior my God" by Aaron Shust from a Christian Radio channel and I was intrigued by the simple but meaningful lyrics. It has became one of my go to song lately. 

The chords and the original strumming pattens are not quite complicate so it is a good song to learn how to play.
