The initial goal for this a race was under 2 hours. 
I am not embitious in this race at all giving I have not train for the past 2 months and my fitness definitely not as good as last November.

Although I couple seconds behind my I initial goal, I am very satisfied in fact. I was just enjoy the race with no high pressure. Somehow this ishow I think race should bein the past couple race. Just enjoy it. Not every race has to be PR.

About the execution, One of the highlight is that this race I got negative splits well and finished the race very strongly. Weather was great, I didn’t overly dressed and it is just warm enough to keep me comfortable. Nurtrition, I have a medium size coffee and a muffin and donut in the morning. Timing was ok as I have almost 2 hours to digest. Finally I also like that at the end of the race I can immediately swap out my wet clothes right after bag check.

One think I didn’t do well this time I didn’t get everything prepare the night before; therefore I couldn’t find my armband for my phoneend up I grabbed my phone on hand the entire race. 

Final comment, Central Park has 2 hills and my execution at the hill definitely didn’t feel power enough so my heart rate and my running form got out of shape.  I guess more hill training is need this years.

Overall, it is a great race.
